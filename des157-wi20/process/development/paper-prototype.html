          <h2>Homepage</h2>
          <img class="image" src="./images/home.jpg" alt="homepage"/>
          <p>My homepage will have the title "Research + Stories = Action" in order
            to show that change can happen with just a few steps. These words will
            be clickable and can take you to that direct page, or you can scroll to
            see the next section.

          <h2>Research</h2>
          <img class="image" src="./images/research.jpg" alt="research"/>
          <img class="image" src="./images/research2.jpg" alt="research2"/>
          <p>Once you scroll down (or click), you will get to the Research
            section. Here there will be information about common mental health
            issues that teenagers face, and you can click on them to learn more.
            A pop-up will appear and you can exit it by clicking the x at the top.
            This section will also feature various graphs and charts to help
            explain the data.

        <article>
          <h2>Stories</h2>
          <img class="image" src="./images/stories.jpg" alt="stories"/>
          <p>If you keep scrolling, you will get to the Stories section of the 
            site. Here I will feature a variety of young adults and their mental
            health struggles in order to bring in a face to connect to the issue.
            Viewers will also have the opportunity to provide their own stories via
            a form at the bottom of the section.

        <article>
          <h2>Action</h2>
          <img class="image" src="./images/action.jpg" alt="action"/>
          <p>Action is the last section. It explains steps you can take to make
            mental health part of the educational curriculum, and provides a form where
            you can input how you're willing to contribute, whether it is provided in 
            the list or not. At the very bottom, there is a "back to top" button to
            take you back to the homepage.
