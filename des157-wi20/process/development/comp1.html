          <h2>Teen Mental Health</h2>
          <img class="image" src="./images/teen1.png" alt="teenmentalhealth.org"/>
          <p>Many mental health websites look a bit old fashioned. With this project,
            I want to create something visually appealing, educational, and easy to
            use. When I looked at the top ten google search results for "interactive
            mental health website," teenmentalhealth.org was the only one that scratched
            the surface of my criteria. The logo was colorful, the aesthetic of the page
            was engaging and eye-catching, and the information was relatable.
          </p>
          <img class="image" src="./images/teen2.png" alt="teenmentalhealth.org"/>
          <p>The menu bar shows the audience their four points of focus; learn, live, 
            care, and explore. Each of these sections of the website takes you to
            a more in-depth page. For example, the "Learn" section goes over topics like
            brain injury, suicide, understanding stress, and more. Having an informational
            side to this project is very important to me because mental health
            is commonly misunderstood. Many people shrug off things like concussions and 
            stress, but these are serious issues. Only by starting off on the right
            foot and educating younger generations now can we expect to raise awareness
            properly.
          </p>
          <img class="image" src="./images/teen3.png" alt="teenmentalhealth.org"/>
          <p>Another positive side is that this website is very organized, and easy 
            to navigate. I especially like the "Our Stories" section because it provides
            firsthand accounts of mental health issues narrated by students. On this page,
            there is also a window to their latest twitter posts, which help show 
            recent developments of the organization. This information is displayed well
            on the website and helps cue the viewer into other topics they may be
            interested in.
          </p>
          <p>I believe that this particular website could use more content, and also
            should provide a way for the audience to engage more with the information
            or others on the platform. It is possible that if this website was turned
            into an app, it could have more of these exciting features.

          <h2>Moodpath</h2>
          <img class="image" src="./images/mood1.png" alt="https://mymoodpath.com/en/"/>
          <p>Looking at various mental health websites made me feel like something was
            lacking. They did not provide personalized content or a way for the audience
            to be active with their mental health. As a result, I decided to look into 
            popular mental health applications on my phone, since they tend to be
            more interactive.
          </p>
          <img class="image" src="./images/mood2.png" alt="https://mymoodpath.com/en/"/>
          <p>Moodpath was the highest rated application on the app store, so I decided
            to take a look at their features. This application not only has educational 
            information, resources, and statistics, but it also is a "companion." You can 
            use it to keep track of your day and moods, and it helps you reflect and keep 
            track of your mental health. The app checks in with its audience through
            personalized questions, and it helps you better understand your emotional 
            state. Having a tool like this could be extremely useful for someone who
            might feel like they aren't doing well, but cannot quite pinpoint it.
            Having a record of these emotions would be useful for when an individual
            might go see a doctor or go to therapy. They could pull up this journal
            of information and start analyzing these patterns in order to get the help
            they need.
          </p>
          <img class="image" src="./images/mood3.png" alt="https://mymoodpath.com/en/"/>
          <p>Another positive aspect of this app is its visual appeal. It's calming colors
            and minimalistic but fun graphics make it enjoyable to use. The interface
            is well structured and designed, so it is definitely a good source of
            inspiration for my own project. I also like that it helps you journal about
            your day. Many people have trouble getting into the habit of journaling,
            but it is a very useful activity. Being able to relax, think about your day,
            and reflect on what you have learned is an important step in life.
          </p>
          <p>If I could create a similar platform to Moodpath but catered towards
            young adults, I think it would advantageous toward teaching younger generations
            to take their mental health seriously. Making it a priority from the beginning
            would help them navigate through obstacles later in life, and alleviate 
            the possibility of feeling overwhelmed by any mental health issues.
